## Acknowledements {.unnumbered}

Huge thanks to the #rstats education community who have made numerous suggestions for this resource, to Lee Suddaby and Zeno Kujawa for converting the homework assignments to learnr tutorials, and to [Müge Çetinkaya](http://muge.fr/) for the hex logo!

This website is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org), the lovely icons by [icons8](http://icons8.com/), and none of this would be possible without the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org).
