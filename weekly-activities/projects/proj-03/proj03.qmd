## Introduction

You will build a HighScores class that keeps track of the top-10 scores for a game. The class will store the scores from highest-to-lowest, and only store at most 10 scores. It will keep track of how many high scores are being stored. The class must store the scores in an array.

The methods that must be defined for the class are: addScore(int score), getScore(i), and getNumScores(), plus, of course, the default constructor.
